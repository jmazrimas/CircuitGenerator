# CircuitGenerator
Basic Ruby program to pull exercise movements from a SQL database and allow the user to create "randomized" circuit workouts and add to/edit/delete from the available movements.

##Files:
* Circuit.db : Database that holds the movements and data related to length/difficulty/etc.
* Circuitgenerator.rb : Main Ruby code that drives the app
* Stockdata.rb : Arrays to "seed" the database with data on the initial run of the application
